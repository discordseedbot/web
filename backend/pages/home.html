SeedBot is a Discord Bot that is mainly aimed at programmers and made <strong>by</strong> programmers. This is mainly due to the DMOJ Module that <a href="https://github.com/finchiedev">FinchieDev</a> developed. Other than the DMOJ Module there are other things in the bot such as, music, fun commands, and moderation bot. Our goal is to make the knockoff but good swiss-army knife of discord bots. If you want to see our wide range of commands then <a href="https://seedbot.xyz?p=commands">come over here</a>. Oh and it's <a href="https://github.com/discordseedbot">open source</a>, <strong>all of it</strong>.
